# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Machine Learning | Fraud Detection | Imbalanced Dataset | SMOTE

End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for Detecting Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions.

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using an imbalanced dataset and SMOTE-based oversampling.

---

## Objective

To detect fraudulent credit card transactions and handle class imbalance effectively using machine learning.

---

## Dataset

Note: The dataset is not included in this repository due to GitHub file size limits.
Download it from Kaggle and place it inside the `data/` folder.

Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Records: 284,807 transactions  
Features: 31 columns  

Target Variable:

`Class`  
- `0` → Normal transaction  
- `1` → Fraud transaction  

Fraud transactions are extremely rare, making this an imbalanced classification problem.

## Model Used

Logistic Regression

---

## Key Learning

This project focuses on imbalanced classification, where fraud transactions make up less than 1% of the dataset.  
SMOTE is used to generate synthetic fraud samples and improve fraud detection performance.

## Result

The model detects fraudulent transactions using logistic regression and handles severe class imbalance using SMOTE.

The trained model achieves strong fraud detection performance with improved recall and F1-score for the minority fraud class.
