End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **SMOTE, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.

This project builds a complete machine learning workflow to identify fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly **imbalanced dataset**.  
The pipeline includes **data preprocessing, class imbalance handling using SMOTE, training multiple models, evaluation, and saving the best model**.

# 📌 Problem Statement

Credit card fraud detection is a challenging machine learning problem because fraudulent transactions are **extremely rare compared to legitimate transactions**.

In the dataset used for this project, fraud cases represent **less than 1% of all transactions**, making it a **severely imbalanced classification problem**.

Traditional machine learning models often fail in such scenarios, so techniques like **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** are used to balance the training data and improve fraud detection performance.

---

# 🎯 Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

- Build a robust **machine learning pipeline for fraud detection**
- Handle **extreme class imbalance using SMOTE**
- Train and compare **multiple machine learning models**
- Evaluate model performance using **classification metrics**
- Save the **best performing model** for future predictions

# 🤖 Machine Learning Models

This project trains and compares multiple machine learning models:

- Logistic Regression (Baseline Model)
- Random Forest (Ensemble Model)
- XGBoost (Gradient Boosting Model)

The models are evaluated using classification metrics to determine the **best performing model**.

---

# 🔄 Project Workflow

The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

1. Data Loading  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Class Distribution Analysis  
4. Train-Test Split  
5. Handling Class Imbalance using SMOTE  
6. Model Training  
7. Model Comparison  
8. Model Evaluation  
9. Best Model Selection  
10. Model Saving  

---

# 📏 Evaluation Metrics

Because fraud detection involves **imbalanced data**, accuracy alone is not sufficient.

The models are evaluated using:

- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

Special focus is given to **Recall and F1-score for the fraud class**, since detecting fraudulent transactions is the primary goal.

# 📈 Results

The machine learning pipeline successfully detects fraudulent credit card transactions by handling class imbalance using **SMOTE** and training multiple classification models.

Ensemble models such as **Random Forest and XGBoost** improve the model's ability to detect fraudulent transactions compared to a simple baseline model.

The final model achieves strong fraud detection performance with improved **Recall and F1-score for the minority fraud class**.
